A simple webservice that implements a CoinJar for your [Starling Bank](https://starlingbank.co.uk) account.

This service watches your [Starling Bank](https://starlingbank.co.uk) transaction log for the things you spend. For any transaction it sees it rounds up the amount to the nearest pound (Â£) and puts it in a virtual coin jar savings goal - much like you would do with the change in your pocket at the end of the day.
